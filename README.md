## React.memo
    The React.memo project explains the usage and purpose of using memos in react.
    Using memo will cause React to skip rendering a component if its props have not changed.
    This can improve performance and highly recommended while working in large apps espcially 
    while there are tens of hundreds of nested child components.
    How?
    At the top of the component insert the react components like so:
    import React from 'react';
    Then while exporting the component which we do not want it to be rendered, export like so:
    export default React.memo(Child);
    This memo will memorize value of the targeted component, and will not allow it to be render while
    the parent component is rendered.
